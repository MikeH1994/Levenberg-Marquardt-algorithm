# Levenberg-Marquardt-algorithm
An attempt to build a Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm from the ground up in C++.

21/7/2016- Matrix class added and working

28/7/2016- LMA class semi-working; able to minimise to the correct value for data sets where there is no noise. Once noise
is introduced to the system, the function no longer converges to the correct result.
